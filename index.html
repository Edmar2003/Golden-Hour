                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I‚Äôm <span>Edmar Tamayosa</span>. For this blog, I want to share some of the photos I‚Äôve taken. 
                   I‚Äôve been learning about how natural light works during golden hour, the special time just after sunrise and before sunset. 
                   But I don‚Äôt only capture sunsets I also enjoy photographing the sky, buildings, the moon, night roads, and even the sunset or night shore. 
                   I decided to go outside and try taking pictures during these times. It wasn‚Äôt easy at first, but I learned a lot about how to adjust my camera settings to get the best shots.</p>

            <h3>The Magic of <span>GOLDEN HOUR</span></h3><br>
            <p>Golden hour is that special time just after sunrise and right before sunset, when the light is soft and warm. 
               It‚Äôs my favorite time to take photos because everything looks magical and different. 
               Whether it‚Äôs a city street or a quiet beach, golden hour turns ordinary scenes into something extraordinary.
               In this post, I‚Äôll share why golden hour is so amazing for photography, especially in the Philippines where the light makes everything come alive. 
               I've captured some of my best moments in places like Manila (Tondo), Bulacan, Lubang Island, and Surigao Del Sur.</p>

                <h3>My <span>GOLDEN HOUR</span> Stories</h3><br>
                <p>One of my favorite golden hour moments was in Lubang Island. 
                   As the sun set, it gave a warm golden glow to the clear ocean. 
                   The scene was so peaceful, and I knew I had to capture it. 
                   Everything seemed to slow down in that moment, and the soft colors made everything look magical. 
                   I sat there for a while, just soaking it all in, feeling grateful for such a beautiful sight.

                   The stars were so bright, and the shooting stars felt like little wishes passing by. 
                   I really wanted to take a photo of it, but my phone‚Äôs camera wasn‚Äôt good enough for such a special moment. 
                   Instead of stressing over it, I just decided to enjoy the view and let the beauty of the night fill me with wonder.
                   Sometimes I watched a meteor shower in the sky. </p>

        <h3>Tips for <span>GOLDEN HOUR</span> Photography</h3>
        <div class="tips-container">
            
            <p>
               Golden hour is perfect for capturing beautiful photos, even with a cellphone. 
               Here are some tips to help you make the most of your phone's camera:
            </p>
            <p>
                ‚Ä¢ Use natural light: Since cellphone cameras don‚Äôt handle low light as well as professional cameras, try to capture golden hour photos while the light is still bright. 
                  Aim for the soft glow just after sunrise or just before sunset to get the best results.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‚Ä¢ Turn off the flash: Your phone‚Äôs flash will often make your photos look unnatural during golden hour. 
                  Instead, use the natural light from the sun to create that warm, soft effect.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‚Ä¢ Tap to focus: Make sure to tap on your screen to focus on the subject. 
                  Cellphones can struggle with depth of field, so this will help you get a sharper image, especially when the light is fading.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‚Ä¢ Try different angles: With a cellphone, you can be quick and creative. 
                  Move around to find unique perspectives, whether it‚Äôs a close-up shot or capturing a wide scene. 
                  Low angles can add drama, and high angles can show the whole scene bathed in golden light.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‚Ä¢ Use editing apps: Don‚Äôt be afraid to enhance your photos after taking them. 
                  Apps like VSCO or Lightroom allow you to adjust brightness, contrast, and warmth to bring out the golden hues.

                <p>Through this platform, I hope to inspire you to explore the world around you and find beauty in the simplest moments. 
                   Whether it‚Äôs a bustling city street at dusk, a peaceful beach at sunrise, or a starry night sky in the countryside, golden hour has the power to transform ordinary scenes into extraordinary ones. 
                   I believe that photography has the ability to tell stories, evoke emotions, and preserve memories, and I want to share that experience with you.
                   <br>
                   Here, you‚Äôll find a collection of my photos taken across various locations in the Philippines, including cities like Manila, quiet islands like Lubang, and breathtaking nature spots like Surigao Del Sur. 
                   Each photo tells its own story, reflecting the beauty of the natural world and the emotions I felt in those moments. 
                   Along with these visuals, I share personal stories and reflections about the places I visit, the lessons I‚Äôve learned, and the challenges I‚Äôve faced along the way.
                    <br>
                   In addition to my own work, this website also includes photography tips and tricks, particularly for capturing the magic of golden hour with a cellphone camera.

                   So whether you‚Äôre a beginner or an experienced photographer, I hope these tips will help you capture your own golden hour moments and inspire you to see the world through a new lens.
